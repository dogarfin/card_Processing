Debit Card Processing

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
Both versions of the debit card processing have four possible commands: charge, credit, summary, and add. The only difference between the two implementations is that for the AL form (Arraylist), every instance of cards is new. In the database version every new instance contains information from the previous instances. 
Every dollar amount needs to be prepended with a $
The format for each command needs to follow the below syntax

There are 2 ways to process commands: 
1) Enter commands line-by-line
ex. 
$ python creditCard.py 
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: add Ben 123412341234123412 $1000
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: charge Tom $500
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: charge Tom $800
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: credit Tom $300
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: summary
Tom: $500
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: exit
Tom: $500

2) Prompt for text file
ex.
$ python creditCard.py
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: ../testfile4.txt
Please enter a file path, credit card information delimited by spaces, or exit: exit
Ed: $-93
Mark: error
Jeff: $500

After exiting the program, you will find a summary file in the directory called 'summaryFiles/' 

There are three test files for processing commands that can be run:
testfile1.txt
testfile2.txt
testfile3.txt
